Krona-Lite is a tiny utility designed for an at-a-glance overview of your tasks. It runs quietly in the background, acting like a super-powered sticky note that appears and disappears instantly with a single keypress.

Press the `END` key to toggle your to-do list, making it perfect for quick checks and hassle-free time tracking without the need for heavy, distracting applications.
